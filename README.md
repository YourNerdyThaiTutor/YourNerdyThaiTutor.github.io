# YourNerdyThaiTutor.github.io

Welcome to Your Nerdy Thai Tutor page. My name is Charinee, a former software engineer, now a full-time educator. I was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand, but been living in the USA since 2014. I do go back to Thailand every year, so might I say I am up to date with the new kids' lingos (somewhat). I'm fluent in both English and Thai. I'm mostly just making these practices so my husband can practice Thai. If anyone has any request for a feature in the lessons or interested in booking a private lesson, feel free to email me at yournerdythaitutor@gmail.com.
